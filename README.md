## Custom javascript menu example

### JS
JS files are split between header.js and scripts.js based on when the element fires in the DOM.

Main menu is loopped through Javascript variables but styling is still controlled on styles.css. 

### Web Server
Localhost uses PHP CLI SAPI's built-in web server.

```php -S localhost:8000```
